Agile testing

Agile test plan should include 3 core elements, as stated in The 10 Minute Test Plan by James Whittaker
Attributes use adverbs/adjectives to describe the high level concepts the testing is meant to ensure i.e., fast, usable, secure, accessible etc. 
Components are the nouns that define major code chuncks that comprise the product Classes, module names and features of the application 
Capabilities are the verbs used to describe user actions/ activities
